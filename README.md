install node and run "npm install" to install gulp. 

Then run "gulp" in the project root and any less code saved will be compiled. You might need to periodically the terminal since gulp halts whenever any syntax errors are pushed. If thats the case, just ctrl-c and gulp again after fixing the error.

Also, you should develop by running the index.html in a webserver as opposed to just displaying the html in a web browser. This one is easy to run in a new terminal window "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000"
Then navigate to "localhost:8000" in your web browser.
